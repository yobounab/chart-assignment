  <p>The number of shooting victims in New York City appears to be decreasing, compared to data from last year, according to the N.Y.P.D., whose officers ramp up citywide gun arrests.</p>

  <p>“The department is seeing positive progress in our decrease in shootings across the city,” N.Y.P.D. Chief of Department Rodney Harrison said on Wednesday, Nov. 3, in a virtual press conference.</p>

  </script>

  <p>But while Harrison congratulated officers and commissioners, data show that the decrease in the number of shooting victims is actually 1% only.</p>

  <p>While shootings in Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island certainly saw a drop, the borough of the Bronx has had an alarming increase of 22% as of last month, compared to the previous year during the same period.</p>

  <p>“The Bronx is the only borough in the city that has over 1,000 gun arrests year-to-date,” Chief Harrison explained.</p>

  <p>All citywide increases, however, took place during the first half of the year —a pattern that only came about because of the Covid-19 pandemic and quarantine. For instance, the month of April saw a rise of 153% of shooting victims in 2021, and March 85.5%.</p>

  </script>

  <p>While Chief Harrison credited this “positive progress” to the N.Y.P.D., he also called on community members to be more involved in neighborhood policing.</p>

  <p>“We need to hear your complaints so we can continue to make this a safe city,” he said.</p>
